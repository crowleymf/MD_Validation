Test case for c36 carbohydrate force field: one glucose molecule in vacuum.

To run:
make

To clean up:
make clean


First the prmtop and inpcrd are created from saved charmm output in
charmm_output/SAVED/onegluc_c36.psf 
and the topology and parameter files in MD_Validation/toppar
par_all36_carb.prm and top_all36_carb.rtf

Force dump comparison output is in charmm_output/SAVED
onegluc_600k_chm.frcdmp  and  onegluc_min_chm.frcdmp

Run script will do the whole test copying the needed files out of
SAVED directories to needed spots.

Requires in your path: chamber, sander

Output to compare is in Amber_output/ with file extension: frcdmp.

Sample output of current versions of charmm and amber 
are in the SAVED directories.

To make new pdb, psf, and frcdmp files, see the method in
MD_Validation/FF_mk_input_goldstd/charmm_ff/OneGluc
Then copy the necessary pdb, psf, and frcdmp files out of the 
pdb and charmm_output directories into the SAVED dirs here.
